This release extends replay from raw orderbook-to-fill evidence into end-to-end ledger reconstruction: signal evidence, market evidence, fees, constraints, entry state, lots, allocations, settlement, event, strategy, and total ledger PnL. It contains no wallet, signing, or real order functionality.

## Settlement Finality Contract
Final settlement rows must be supported by resolved final public evidence. Proposed, pending, disputed, or unknown winner states cannot be booked as final payouts.
